# Admonitions




Our [MkDocs theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) supports admonitions. They stand out from the body text and deliberately disrupt the reading flow. Use them sparingly.

Some common admonition styles:

danger

!!! danger "This can break"

info

!!! info "Information you need"

question

!!! question "Is that the question?"

quote

!!! quote "To quote or not to quote"

success

??? success "The answer lies herein"

    Yes, here.

summary

???+ summary "TL;DR"

    Kdb+ is great. Just use it.

tip

!!! tip "This is a tip"

warning

!!! warning "Watch out for this"
