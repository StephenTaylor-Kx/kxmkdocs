Template for KX documentation subsite
=====================================

The content at [code.kx.com](https://code.kx.com/) consists of static HTML subsites generated by [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org). 
This repo is a template for a MkDocs instance for such a subsite.

It uses the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme, and font files from [Swiss Typefaces](https://swisstypefaces.com), licensed for use only on kx.com. 

The `serve.sh` and `build.sh` scripts run MkDocs within a Docker container generated from `Dockerfile` and `requirements.txt` in this folder.
